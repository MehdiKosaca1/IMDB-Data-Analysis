Analysis of Factors Influencing IMDB Ratings

This project investigates the key factors influencing IMDB ratings using a dataset of the top 2,000 movies sourced from Kaggle. The analysis includes cleaning and transforming the dataset, handling missing data, and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and patterns. Key features such as genres, directors, movie duration, and box office revenue were analyzed for their impact on IMDB ratings. Visualizations and statistical summaries provide actionable insights for stakeholders in the film industry. The findings can assist filmmakers, critics, and audiences in understanding the elements contributing to a movie's success.
